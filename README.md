# AoC 2022

My solutions for the 2022 edition of Advent of Code in Rust.

Simply run `cargo run --release --bin dayXX` to solve.

Some days require `Z3`, install it to the system libraries, or on Windows
download binaries from https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3/releases and unzip to a
folder named `z3` in the crate root. Then run that day with `--features z3`.
